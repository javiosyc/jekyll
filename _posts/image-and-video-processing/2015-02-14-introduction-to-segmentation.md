##Image and Video Segmentation

1.the basic idea is that we want to separate objects.

2.We want to call different objects by different names, depending on some properties of those objects.


### Foreground Background Segmentation

So for example, here we have a cat and we want to make sure that we find the boundary of this cat and we can separate he cat here from it's background.

this type of segmentation is called foreground background 

### Electro Microscopy Segmentation

Sometimes, what we actually need is to label every thing that have been seen the 
image.

So to find regions in these image, which is an image of neurons taking with a technique called electro microscopy.

### After Effects - this is what's behind a  very important component of one of Adobe's products.

We have the **video** and we have a similar video, but with a different background. 

For doing that, we had to extract the main object here from the video.

So, we are able to produce a different background for that.

## Hough Transform with Matlad Demo - 5.3

The Hough transform is a really nice technique to detect objects, to segment out objects, for which **you know their shape**.

For example we want to detect the ball. We know it's circular

we include that information in our detection, in our segmentation technique, to detect that it's actually circular.
